# Advent Of Code 2018 (with ranges)

https://adventofcode.com/

Lazy attempt to check out Erics' [ranges-v3](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3) library features.

## Build instructions

Fairly standard CMake based setup. Note that the ranges library currently does not compile under MSVC.

```
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && cmake --build .
```
